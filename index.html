      Hello there! My name is Steven Rejdukowski and I am a developer at Code Fellows and this is a little website about
      me.
      I currently reside in Chicago and have been in Illinois all my life. I went to the College of Dupage for a few years
      and received a certificate in music production. For the past 8 years, I have been working as the online product
      manager at a small business named A Sound Education. I have worked with the Shopify platform as well as sites like
      Reverb.com to get musical products to customers across the United States. I am excited about learning and taking in
      as much information as I can during my Code Fellows experience as well as making new connections with fellow
      developers. Thanks for stopping by my page!

    </p>
